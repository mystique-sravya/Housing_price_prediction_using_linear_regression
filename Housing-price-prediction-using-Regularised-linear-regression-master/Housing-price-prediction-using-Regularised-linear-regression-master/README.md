# Housing-price-prediction-using-Regularised-linear-regression

## Problem Statement

##### The goal of this project is to predict the prices of houses based on several factors and study the relationship between them. On completion, you will be able to interpret how each of these factors affects housing prices.

## Dataset

##### Here, you will use a dataset with over 13 features, including ID (to count the records), zones, area (size of the lot in square feet), build type (type of dwelling), year of construction, year of remodeling (if valid), sale price (to be predicted), and a few more.

###### config

1. upload the ipynb file to Google colab
2. upload the csv file to Google colab
3. run all cells
